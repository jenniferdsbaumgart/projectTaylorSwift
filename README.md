## Code Explanation

JavaScript Logic

- The JavaScript functionality enables users to interact with the image carousel by following these steps:
- Event Listener for Buttons: Each button in the carousel has an event listener to detect clicks.
- Deselecting the Previous Button: When a user clicks a new button, the previously selected button is deselected.
- Selecting the Active Button: The clicked button is marked as the active selection.
- Hiding the Previous Image: The currently displayed image is hidden before displaying the new one.
- Displaying the New Image: Based on the button clicked, the corresponding image of the album era is displayed.

HTML Structure:

- Main Carousel: Displays images of Taylor Swift's album covers.
- Buttons: Clicking each button will switch between album images.
- Sidebar Menu: Links to Taylor Swift's social media profiles (LinkedIn and GitHub).

Layout and Styling

- CSS: The layout is styled using Flexbox and includes responsive design rules for optimal viewing on various screen sizes.
- Font: Google Fonts' Poppins font is used for the text elements for a clean and modern design.
- Icons: Font Awesome icons are used for the social media buttons.
